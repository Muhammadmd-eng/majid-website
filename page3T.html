      <h3><p>Dear Tomi</p></h3>
      <p>Honestly, its been quite a while since we've known each other</p>
      <p>
        There are so many things I’ve been wanting to say, and I think it’s time
        I put them into words. Having you as my friend is something I don’t take
        lightly, because people like you are rare. You have this way of making
        life feel lighter, of making ordinary moments turn into memories I
        actually want to hold on to. And honestly, that means so much to me.
        I’ve realized that friendship isn’t just about having someone to talk
        to—it’s about having someone who listens, understands, and accepts you
        exactly as you are. That’s what I feel with you. With you, I don’t have
        to hide parts of myself or pretend to be someone I’m not. I can be real,
        and that’s something I’ll always appreciate. I want you to know that no
        matter what,Besides GOD, I’ll always be here for you. Not just for the
        fun times, but also for the quiet, heavy, or difficult ones. If you ever
        feel like you’re walking alone,besides GOD I’ll be the person beside
        you, reminding you that you’re never truly alone. Life will keep
        changing, and we’ll both keep growing, but I hope our friendship stays
        strong through it all. I’m looking forward to the laughs we haven’t
        shared yet, the challenges we’ll help each other through, and the
        memories that are still waiting to be made. Thank you for being such an
        important part of my life. You’re not just a friend—you’re someone I
        truly value, someone who’s made a difference in ways I can’t fully
        explain. And I just want you to remember, always, how much you matter.
